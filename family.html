  <h1>Family</h1>
  <h3>This page talks about my family. We like to go out and travel around the world. As a family, we are generally very easygoing with each other. 
    My parents are very supportive of anything that I choose to take up and they always encourage me to challenge myself.

    On a more personal note, my dad and mom are both very good at cooking, although their styles are entirely different. 
    My mom likes to get recipes done in quick fashion and can make the best food but at a much faster pace. 
        When she cooks, she puts her own take on recipes and follows her culinary instincts to decide quantities.

        In polar contrast, my dad loves going through the entire process step by step slowly and is a complete meat guy. 
        He likes to make dishes that are meaningful.One of their only similarities cooking - wise is their extensive knowledge of 
      food and how to make a recipe their own. </h3>
