  <h1>Fun</h1>
  <h3>In my spare time for fun, I like to play outside with friends. I'm a big fan of basketball and soccer, and enjoy taking part in the sport as well as watching it.</h3>
  <h3>By now, it is probably quite clear that I love to travel. This is one way that I can have a lot of fun when I get time off.</h3>
      <h3>This is the Barcelona soccer team stadium that we visited in Spain.</h3>

  <h3>I also play video games from time to time. My interests gaming - wise are pretty varied, 
      so I play many different categories of games including but not limited to sports, AAA titles, stealth, and story - driven games.</h3>
